# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
# Output: 7
# Explanation:
# The possible combination ways are:
# (1, 1, 1, 1)
# (1, 1, 2)
# (1, 2, 1)
# (1, 3)
# (2, 1, 1)
# (2, 2)
# (3, 1)
# Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [9], target = 3
# Output: 0
