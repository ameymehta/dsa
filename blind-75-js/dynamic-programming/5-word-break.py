# Example 1:
# Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
# Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

# Example 3:
# Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
# Output: false
